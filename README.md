Notes
----------------------------------------
This mod takes a chunk out of the defualt game's RAM. It is likely the game will crash if you enter a battle with multiple capital ships,
this is caused by a large amount of fighters, something this game was not meant to handle.
I recommend installing a Large Adress Aware program to increase the game's RAM amount.
